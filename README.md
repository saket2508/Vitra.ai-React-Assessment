## Vitra.ai React Assessment

- This repo contains the source code for a task that was given as part of Vitra.ai's full-stack intern assessment.

- We had to design a UI where a list of employees along with their details is visible. A JSON file containing user data was shared.

- I have used MaterialUI and Styles Components for styling the app.

- It has been hosted on Netlify and is live [here](https://assignment-saket-vitraai.netlify.app)
